Restful WebServices:
"REST". Representational State Transfer Rest is alternative to Soap Protocol Though SOAP is considered as the standard protocol for web services communication,it is not the only possible transport protocol which is used The WS-* extensions such as WS-Security, WS-Addressing, and WSReliableMessaging are associated with SOAP messaging due to this extensible nature

RESTful web services can be considered as a lightweight alternative Rest is not a protocol

Rest Service:
